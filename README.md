Description
This Python program reads content from a specified file, modifies the content (converts it to uppercase), and writes the modified content to a new file. It includes basic error handling to ensure a smooth user experience.

Features
Reads content from an input file provided by the user.
Converts the content to uppercase as an example modification.
Writes the modified content to an output file specified by the user.
Handles errors gracefully, such as when the input file does not exist.

How to Use
Run the script in a Python environment.
When prompted, provide the name of the file you want to read.
Enter the name of the file to write the modified content.
If the input file exists, the program writes the modified content to the output file and notifies the user.
If the input file doesnâ€™t exist, the program will display an error message.
